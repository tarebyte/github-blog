# GitHub Blog

I really enjoyed having the [GitHub blog](https://github.com/blog) on my header, apart from that the new header is awesome! :sparkles:

## Installation

### Chrome Web Store

As of right now, this is not on the Chrome Web Store, maybe in the near future though.

### Developer mode

If you want to hack on the extension, you'll need to install it manually. First clone or fork this repo. Then, on your Extensions page, make sure "Developer mode" is checked. You can then click the "Load unpacked extension..." button and browse to the `chrome` directory of this repo.

## Hacking

To hack on the extension, you'll first need to make sure you've installed it in Developer mode (see above). Once you've made changes to the extension, go back to the Extensions page and click the Reload link under the extension entry.
